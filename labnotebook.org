- [X] Check if simulations are saving a log-transformed .tar of data.
- [X] If not, implement that in simulations: make a folder of unique npys with the log data, then tar that.
- [X] Test the new stuff locally.
- [X] Check if cluster scripts are saving the .tar of log-transformed data.
- [X] If not, make them save that as well.
- [X] Git update everything.
- [X] Move existing cluster simulations to their own folder, create a new one for raw simulations.
- [X] Now we just need to re-run cluster simulations, yet again. Do this *after* debugging the new simulation results.

- My hypothesis was that all SLURM tasks from a single array job are happening in the same workdir, and thus the snakemake input/output calculations are going haywire.
- It turns out that the =/workdir= scratch space on =cbsubscb10= was 100% full, so you couldn't =mkdir= a folder there; I was getting this mysterious "Input/output error". So instead of creating a directory in scratch and switching to it, we were running simulations from inside home in multiple jobs and tasks, causing a huge amount of race conditions. The temporary solution is to avoid =cbsubscb10= for now and hope no other compute nodes have the same problem.
- [X] Wait for everything to run in the cluster.
- [X] Download the tars.
- [X] Check the SLURM output for the logs.
- [X] Does every data tar contain the same NPY files? No...
- [X] Change name of output file to include slurm job array ID. Locally.
- [X] Change workdir to include slurm job array ID. Locally.
- [X] slurm array task id vs. slurm array job id.
- [X] Git update just the slurm script.
- [X] Clean cluster folder of slurm outputs.
- [X] Check workdirs.
- [X] Confirm cluster slurm output are alright.
- [X] Re-run with very few simulations jobs; comment original amounts out.
- [X] Confirm it runs properly.
- [X] Confirm there are not extra files in =~/drosophila-sweeps=.
- [X] Git checkout of the slurm sbatch script so simulation amounts are back to normal.
- [X] Update git from the cluster: fetch, merge, then commit and push.
- [X] Delete local simulations.
- [X] Read SLURM outputs to see what failed.
- [X] Make testing SLURM scripts.
- [X] See if I run into the same mistake as before.
- [X] Re-run simulations with only a couple of runs.
- [X] Clean up =benchmark=, =output= and =bin= from the main folder.
- [X] Do not use cbsubscb10.
- [X] Try re-running the big ones now.
